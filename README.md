# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction
This project uses react hooks to keep track of state and render components as soon as data changes. This also uses react router to route between pages.

### Live Working
Deployed [here](https://react-router-app-gamma.vercel.app/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
